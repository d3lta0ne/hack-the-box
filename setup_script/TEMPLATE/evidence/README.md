Findings
We suggest creating a folder for each finding you plan to include in the report to keep your evidence for each finding in a container to make piecing the walkthrough together easier when you write the report.

Scans

Vulnerability scans
Export files from your vulnerability scanner (if applicable for the assessment type) for archiving.

Service Enumeration
Export files from tools you use to enumerate services in the target environment like Nmap, Masscan, Rumble, etc.

Web
Export files for tools such as ZAP or Burp state files, EyeWitness, Aquatone, etc.

AD Enumeration
JSON files from BloodHound, CSV files generated from PowerView or ADRecon, Ping Castle data, Snaffler log files, CrackMapExec logs, data from Impacket tools, etc.

Notes
A folder to keep your notes in.

OSINT
Any OSINT output from tools like Intelx and Maltego that doesn't fit well in your notes document.

Wireless
Optional if wireless testing is in scope, you can use this folder for output from wireless testing tools.

Logging output
Logging output from Tmux, Metasploit, and any other log output that does not fit the Scan subdirectories listed above.

Misc Files
Web shells, payloads, custom scripts, and any other files generated during the assessment that are relevant to the project.
